A PostScript security envelope generator.

Produce a full page or random letters of random font and font size,
with a specific density. This is more a proof of concept rather than
an actual security feature; a security envelope should be better tuned
to the contents of the envelope itself, including similar fonts and
font sizes, and an appropriate density.

See the source to modify paper size and letter density.
